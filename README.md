# Owl2
🦉 **Owl2/جغدک** is a simple android application for **OwlBot dictionary**. (a reincarnation of https://github.com/yamin8000/Owl)

Owl2 is the first project in that I used **Jetpack Compose UI** and **Material3** color system. Currently, Google's recommendation is to use MVVM architecture. But I didn't feel it necessary to use MVVM architecture because this project was simple, and adding such an architecture would make it more complex and had no benefits.
